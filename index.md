E-portfolio


Professional Self-Assessment
Completing the computer science program at SNHU has helped me learn a lot and become a better software engineer. Developing my e-portfolio has had me go through all of the work that I have completed during my time at SNHU and has shown me how far I have come. The program has helped me realize that I have a passion for programming and computer science in general. I have completed many projects during my time in college and have developed many skills to show for it. I have taken courses covering collaboration, where we collectively developed a java application that contained all of our favorite songs, we collaborated using git code management, using bitbucket. I have also taken many courses that helped to develop the required non-programming related skill it takes to become a successful software engineer, I have learned to create wireframes, code tests, prototypes and more during my time. Data Structures and algorithms have been covered in my coursework as well with topics such as linked lists, binary search trees and quick search algorithms being emphasized. I also have developed skills in both SQL databases and NoSQL databases in the form of MongoDB. This is only a brief description of some of the skills that I have developed during my time in college.
